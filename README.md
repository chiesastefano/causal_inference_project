# The Causal Effect of Productivity on Wages

## Abstract
This paper examines the causal relationship between productivity and wages in
Europe, employing robust econometric methodologies to analyze the dynamics at
play. Utilizing a fixed-effects cross-country regression model, the study incorporates
lagged productivity changes alongside control variables such as inflation, education
levels, and market competition to understand their influence on real hourly wage
adjustments. The findings reinforce the decoupling of wage and productivity thesis,
showing a not statistically significant effect of productivity on wages.
